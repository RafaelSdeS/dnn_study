## Run 1 — Kernel size sweep on PCAD (2026-09-13 → 2026-09-15) ✓

Submitted via `python -m scripts.cluster submit-sweep --experiment
phase_11_kernel_size_comparison --runtime pcad`, jobs 821242-821245 (AlexNets)
+ 821270-821271 (VGGs). All 5 models completed FP32 (500ep) + QAT (100ep),
no early stopping (`_protocols/no_patience.yaml`).

| Model | FP32 Top-1 | FP32 Top-5 | QAT Top-1 | QAT Top-5 | INT8 Top-1 | INT8 Top-5 |
|-------|-----------:|-----------:|----------:|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| alexnet_tv_scratch (orig. 11×11/5×5/3×3) | 27.51% | 52.28% | 23.55% | 46.46% | 22.91% | 46.72% |
| alexnet_tv_3x3 | 24.84% | 48.47% | 23.60% | 46.51% | 23.13% | 46.35% |
| alexnet_tv_2x2 | 23.93% | 46.26% | 22.50% | 44.90% | 22.03% | 44.64% |
| **vgg16_original** (native 3×3) | 47.71% | 70.22% | **0.50%** | **2.50%** | **0.50%** | **2.50%** |
| vgg16_2x2 | 54.26% | 75.96% | 49.03% | 69.09% | 48.29% | 67.73% |

Results aggregated to `results/phase_11_kernel_size_comparison/` and
`results/runs_index.csv` via `scripts/build_runs_index.py`. Renamed the
`vgg16` run dir/model slot to `vgg16_original` (both PCAD and local) once the
naming ambiguity with `vgg16_2x2` became confusing to read in tables.

## Finding — vgg16_original's QAT stage collapses to random-guess (2026-09-15)

**Symptom:** FP32 47.71% top-1 → QAT/INT8 0.50% (= 1/200, exactly random).
vgg16_2x2, same fuse map, same lr, same QAT schedule, degrades normally
(54.26% → 49.03%, a typical ~5pp QAT drop).

**Root-cause investigation** (PCAD job 821270 stderr,
`outputs/pcad/logs/phase_11_kernel_size_comparison/train.sbatch-821270.err`):

- QAT epoch 1 val_acc is *already* 0.50% — the model is broken before any
  fine-tuning happens, at the moment fake-quantization is enabled.
- Epochs 1-5 (observers still active) oscillate near-randomly; at epoch 6
  (`disable_observer_epoch: 5` in `configs/qat.yaml`) the loss locks to
  exactly `ln(200) = 5.2983` bit-for-bit for the remaining 94 epochs.
  `disable_observer` isn't the cause — it just freezes an already-broken
  state permanently (compare vgg16_2x2, which is *already climbing* by
  epoch 1 — 4.74% → 6.47% — and jumps to 31.70% the instant observers
  disable at epoch 6).
- No NaN/Inf in the logs — this is a silent quantization-range collapse,
  not a crash.
- Checked `BatchNorm.running_var` directly off the two FP32 `_best.pth`
  checkpoints (no forward pass needed): vgg16_original runs 2-12x hotter
  than vgg16_2x2 across nearly every conv stage, e.g. `features.18`
  216 vs 19.9, `features.21` 219 vs 18.9, `features.25` 275 vs 29.9; the
  final stage (`features.41`) hits running_var ~15,384 vs ~5,429.

**Hypothesis:** kernel_size=3 with `padding=1` on *every* one of the 13
conv layers (VGG16's native design, see `models/baselines.py:_vgg16_features`)
preserves spatial size at every stage with no padding-parity break, letting
activation variance compound layer-to-layer far more than the kernel_size=2
variant (which alternates 1/0 padding per stage). With INT8 fake-quant's
fixed ~256-level range, a BN-fused conv layer with this much activation
variance saturates almost every activation to the same quantization bin,
and with 13 such layers in series the information loss compounds into a
fully collapsed (uniform-output) network from the very first QAT forward
pass — well before any gradient step could plausibly cause it.

**Status:** not a code bug — this looks like a genuine numerical instability
in quantizing the native (unrestricted) VGG16 kernel size, arguably itself
a relevant Phase 11 finding (kernel restriction can be *required* for
quantizability, not just efficiency). Left as-is; not retrained.

**If revisited**, options in decreasing preference: (1) report the failure
as-is as a finding, (2) swap `MovingAverageMinMaxObserver` for
`HistogramObserver` in `ml/quantization.py`'s qconfig (more outlier-robust,
untested here), (3) retrain FP32 with stronger weight decay / lower BN
momentum to control activation variance, then redo QAT.
